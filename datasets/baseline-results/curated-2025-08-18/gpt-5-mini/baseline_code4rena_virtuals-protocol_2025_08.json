As a result, by default no account has TOKEN_SAVER_ROLE and no account has the admin role needed to call grantRole for TOKEN_SAVER_ROLE.\n\nWhere it occurs:\nThere is no constructor or initializer in the TokenSaver contract that calls _setupRole / grantRole. The restriction is enforced in saveToken() via onlyTokenSaver (saveToken function).\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nIf tokens are sent to this contract (e.g., accidentally or intentionally), there may be no way to ever call saveToken because no one ever has the TOKEN_SAVER_ROLE and no one has the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE required to grant it. That effectively locks tokens inside the contract permanently.\n\nPotential impact:\nLoss of funds \u2014 tokens held by this contract can become irretrievable.

That means a voter trying to cast the vote that reaches 100% can have their vote transaction reverted because the proposal execution fails \u2014 effectively preventing the finalizing vote from succeeding and blocking progress. An attacker could craft a proposal whose execution intentionally reverts to block any auto-execution and cause voters to repeatedly fail.\n- Timing/ordering manipulation: because execute happens inside the vote transaction, a malicious proposal target could observe being called from the Governor and perform actions that affect vote accounting or token snapshots if it can reach external state used by the Governor, causing unpredictable results.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Loss of liveness: legitimate proposals could never successfully auto-execute because execution can revert and blow up voter transactions.\n- Reentrancy exploits: arbitrary governance actions might be leveraged to change contract state mid-vote, enabling privilege escalation or state corruption depending on the target contracts.\n- Funds loss or unauthorized actions if executed targets are manipulated via reentrancy.\n\nvulnerability_type: \"reentrancy / external-call reentrancy / DoS by external call\",\nseverity: \"high\",\nconfidence: 0.9,\nlocation: \"_castVote(...) -> _tryAutoExecute(...) -> execute(proposalId) (internal call path)\" \n    \n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Unprotected IERC721.ownerOf call in _updateMaturity can revert and break voting (DoS)\",\n    \"description\": \"What the vulnerability is:\\n- _updateMaturity calls IERC721(contributionNft).ownerOf(proposalId) and then checks if owner == address(0) to early return.

      "description": "What: Agent rewards store totalProposals (IAgentDAO.proposalCount()) in _distributeAgentReward and later use it as a divisor when computing per-account rewards. If totalProposals == 0, subsequent reward claim computations divide by zero and revert.\n\nWhere: _distributeAgentReward() creates AgentReward(..., totalProposals, ...). The problematic divisions occur in getClaimableStakerRewards() and getClaimableValidatorRewards():\n- getClaimableStakerRewards(): stakerReward = (stakerReward * uptime) / agentReward.totalProposals;\n- getClaimableValidatorRewards(): validatorReward = (validatorReward * uptime) / agentReward.totalProposals;\n\nWhy it's a security issue: A zero totalProposals causes a runtime revert when callers attempt to compute/claim rewards for that AgentReward entry. Because rewards are processed in chronological batches, encountering a zero-totalProposals record will cause claim functions to revert or stop processing, preventing users from claiming rewards for that virtualId (and possibly for later rewards if the claim pointers are not advanced). This is a Denial-of-Service against reward claims.\n\nPotential impact: Users (stakers/validators) may be unable to claim rewards permanently for the affected virtualId. Funds can remain locked in the contract or unclaimable until the code is changed (upgrade) or some external mitigation is performed.\n",

The contract has a noReentrant modifier, but it's not applied to distributeRewards.\n\nWhere: distributeRewards() performs IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount); then reads LP balances and external nft/dao state, then _rewards.push(...) and calls _distributeAgentReward which updates _agentRewards and _nextAgentRewardId.\n\nWhy it's a security issue: If any of the external calls (notably ERC20.safeTransferFrom or token/agentNft implementations called during the function) are malicious or compromised and invoke a callback into this contract, the contract may be re-entered in an inconsistent state. An attacker with control of a malicious reward token or malicious agentNft/DAO could reenter and cause double-counting, manipulate _nextAgentRewardId or _rewards/_agentRewards ordering, or otherwise produce inconsistent/incorrect bookkeeping that could be exploited to siphon funds or corrupt state.\n\nPotential impact: Creation of incorrect reward records, duplicated rewards, or manipulation of reward accounting enabling theft of tokens or denial of proper reward distribution. Because distributeRewards is gated by GOV_ROLE, an attacker would need GOV_ROLE or to control a malicious token/NFT used in the call flow.

No reentrancy guard protects distributeRewards().\n\nWhy it's a security issue: Even though these calls are intended to be view-like, malicious implementations can perform reentrancy into this contract and exploit the fact that state (e.g., _nextAgentRewardId, _rewards) is in flux.

This manifests as a denial of service for token holders who cannot move or spend their tokens via standard mechanisms.\n\nImpact: holders and integrators cannot perform transfers or spend allowances, causing functional DoS of token utility.
