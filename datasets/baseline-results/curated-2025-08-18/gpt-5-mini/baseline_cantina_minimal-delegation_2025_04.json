This key is used to derive signer and signerTestKey and is assumed to control a sensitive account in tests. If this key (or code containing it) is reused outside the test environment, or if tests inadvertently run against real networks or configurations, the account is trivially compromised because the private key is public in source control.\n\nWhere it occurs: declaration of signerPrivateKey and its usage to derive signer and signerTestKey (top-level state declarations).\n\nWhy it's a security issue: embedding private keys in source code creates an immediate secret-leak vulnerability. Anyone with access to the repository or build artifacts can derive the account and sign transactions as that user. In CI or developer machines this can lead to reuse of the same key in non-test contexts.\n\nPotential impact: full compromise of the derived signer account: funds drain, unauthorized operations, impersonation of signer in any on-chain interaction that uses this key.\n",

If similar behavior (ability to write arbitrary code or alter code at an address) exists or is mirrored in deployment scripts or misused in custom test harnesses running on public testnets/mainnet, it permits account impersonation, bypass of access control and arbitrary fund extraction. Additionally, if any of this test scaffolding were mistakenly deployed or included in on-chain code (or a custom RPC layer exposing such functionality), it would enable complete takeover of contracts and addresses.\n\nPotential impact: impersonation of critical accounts (signer), bypassing authentication, unauthorized access to funds and privileged functions during testing or if the technique is misapplied outside isolated test environments.\n",

Depending on how the bytes4 selector value is represented in the assembly slot, the shr(224, selector) operation can zero-out or corrupt the selector portion instead of placing the 4 selector bytes into the intended low-order bytes of the result. If the selector is already right-aligned (low bytes), shifting it right by 224 bits will produce 0.\nWhere: _packCanExecute(address to, bytes4 selector) internal pure returns (bytes32 result) \u2014 assembly block.\nWhy it's a security issue: If selector bits are zeroed or packed incorrectly, packed keys will collapse to just the address portion. That makes the set of permitted selectors indistinguishable (or collisions occur) and could allow execution of functions that were not intended to be authorized (e.g., granting permission for address X effectively authorizes all selectors for X, or different selectors/addresses collide). This breaks the selector granularity of the permission model and could escalate privileges.\nPotential impact: Permission escalation: entries intended to grant access to a specific selector may end up granting access to other selectors (or to all selectors for a target) due to packing collisions or lost selector fields, enabling unauthorized calls and possible theft or state corruption.\nVulnerability type: Data packing bug / logic bug leading to authorization bypass\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.60\nlocation: \"_packCanExecute(address to, bytes4 selector) internal pure \u2014 assembly block using shl(96, to) and shr(224, selector)\"\n",

      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\n- The library derives the transient storage slot solely from the spender address (keccak256(padded address)). This yields a single global slot per spender across the entire transaction scope. Transient storage (tstore/tload) is transaction-scoped and not isolated by contract, so different contracts (or attacker-controlled contracts) executing within the same transaction can access and modify the same transient slot for the same spender.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- _computeSlot(address spender) (used by get and set) \u2014 the slot is computed only from the spender address. get(address) and set(address,uint256) then read/write that slot via tload/tstore.\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- Because the slot key is predictable (only depends on a public address) and transient storage is shared across contracts in the same transaction, an attacker or another contract executed in the same transaction can pre-set or overwrite the transient allowance for a target spender before the intended contract reads it. There is no domain separation (contract address, purpose or a namespace tag), so two different contracts using this library with the same spender address will collide.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Unauthorized access or protocol manipulation: an attacker can spoof a transient allowance value that a victim contract will trust, potentially enabling unauthorized actions (for example bypassing authorization checks or causing transfers/operations that rely on transient allowance). This can directly lead to loss of funds or privilege escalation depending on how the library is used.\n\nVulnerability type: storage collision / predictable key / cross-contract state manipulation\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.9\nLocation: _computeSlot(), get(), set() (TransientAllowance.sol)",

      "description": "The function removeSelector(bytes calldata data) uses inline assembly to set params.offset := add(data.offset, 4) and params.length := sub(data.length, 4) without validating that data.length >= 4. In Yul/inline assembly arithmetic is unchecked, so if data.length < 4 the subtraction will underflow and produce a very large length value. This returns a bytes calldata that claims to reference a huge slice beyond the actual calldata bounds.\n\nWhere it occurs: removeSelector(bytes calldata) function, inside the assembly block that assigns params.offset and params.length.\n\nWhy it's a security issue: A malformed calldata slice with an enormous length can cause downstream operations (e.g., abi.decode, calldata copying, or other code that consumes the returned bytes calldata) to behave unexpectedly. Typical outcomes include out-of-bounds calldata copy reverts (denial-of-service), unexpected decoding behavior, or other control-flow anomalies in callers that assume the returned slice is well-formed. In some contexts, wrongly-decoded parameters could cause logic errors that lead to misrouting of funds or privilege misuse.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Denial-of-service: calls that rely on removeSelector may revert when later attempting to access the claimed slice.\n- Unexpected/incorrect decoding: callers may decode garbage or trigger revert paths, possibly enabling logic-level exploits depending on caller code.\n- In certain call-chains, malformed parameters could be used to alter control flow or bypass checks, potentially leading to financial loss or unauthorized actions (depending on how the returned bytes are used).\n\nMitigation: validate data.length >= 4 before computing the slice (e.g., require(data.length >= 4)) or perform the subtraction with a checked/guarded branch in Solidity rather than unchecked assembly.",
