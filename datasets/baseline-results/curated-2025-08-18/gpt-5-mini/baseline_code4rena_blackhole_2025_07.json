OpenZeppelin-style ERC20Votes / snapshotting implementations (and typical \"getPastTotalSupply\" APIs) expect a block number (uint256 blockNumber) as the snapshot parameter, not a timestamp. Passing block.timestamp (seconds, not block number) will very likely query an invalid snapshot and return 0 or an unexpected value.\n\nWhere it occurs:\nFunction: proposalThreshold()\nCode: return (token.getPastTotalSupply(block.timestamp) * proposalNumerator) / PROPOSAL_DENOMINATOR;\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nIf getPastTotalSupply returns 0 (or a much smaller value) because it's given a timestamp instead of a block number, the calculated proposal threshold may become zero or trivially small. That would allow any address (including malicious actors) to create governance proposals regardless of voting power, bypassing the intended proposal barrier.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Anyone can spam or create arbitrary proposals, including ones that schedule calls to the minter contract (the governor already restricts proposals to the minter.nudge call). This enables governance spam and gravity toward malicious proposals.\n- If proposals can be passed or queued with low thresholds, attackers can perform governance takeovers or schedule harmful actions targeting the minter (depending on minter.nudge behavior).\n\nVulnerability type: Incorrect parameter / logic leading to privilege escalation (bypass of proposal threshold)\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: proposalThreshold() function",

A malicious _pair contract or a malicious factory could reenter this contract (or invoke other contracts that rely on this contract) during those external calls and affect state or call back into functions in this contract. Even if direct reentrancy to setDeployerForPair is limited by isCustomDeployer checks, a malicious external call may invoke other flows that manipulate registrations, the permission registry, or other contracts that ultimately change system behavior.\\n\\nPotential impact:\\n- Depending on system-level trust assumptions, an attacker controlling _pair or algebraFactory could cause inconsistent state transitions, race conditions, or trigger other administrative flows that lead to misconfiguration or unauthorized privilege assignment. At minimum, this increases attack surface and could enable complex exploit chains.\\n\nvulnerability_type: \"reentrancy / checks-effects-interactions violation\"\nseverity: \"medium\"\nconfidence: 0.7\nlocation: \"setDeployerForPair(address) and setDeployerForPair(address,address) \u2014 external calls to IAlgebraPool(_pair).token0(), token1() and algebraFactory.customPoolByPair(...) occur before pairToDeployer assignment\"\n  } ,\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Trust on external permissionRegistry and algebraFactory addresses (supply-chain / single-point-of-trust risk)\",\n    \"description\": \"What the vulnerability is:\\n- The contract relies entirely on two external addresses provided at initialization: algebraFactory and permissionRegistry.

Also accepting arbitrary addresses without checks increases chance of misconfiguration or accidental lockout.\\n\\nPotential impact:\\n- Denial of service or privilege removal for pools whose deployer mapping gets set to zero; possible breaking of downstream logic that assumes a valid deployer address.\\n\nvulnerability_type: \"input validation / configuration\"\n    ,\n    \"severity\": \"low\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.8,\n    \"location\": \"addCustomDeployer(...) and setDeployerForPair(address,address)\"\n  }\n].json: invalid format.
