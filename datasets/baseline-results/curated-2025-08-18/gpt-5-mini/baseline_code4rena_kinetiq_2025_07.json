The external contract can execute arbitrary logic and could attempt to interact with this contract in ways that rely on the current state. Although rebalanceWithdrawal and closeRebalanceRequests are nonReentrant, other state-modifying functions that do not carry the nonReentrant guard could still be invoked by the stakingManager contract (if they are callable without role restrictions). This could allow a malicious stakingManager to trigger unexpected state changes or denial of service via crafted callbacks.\n\nPotential impact: A privileged manager could intentionally pass an invalid or malicious stakingManager causing the call to revert (DoS of that operation) or enabling the external contract to perform malicious callbacks to manipulate state (depending on which functions the stakingManager can call back to).

An EOA that is the admin of an upgradeable proxy can directly perform privileged admin operations (upgrade implementations) if its private key is compromised.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- In setUp(), multiple TransparentUpgradeableProxy instances are created with the `admin` address as their admin (lines around the TransparentUpgradeableProxy(...) constructor calls for pauserRegistryProxy, stakingManagerProxy, kHYPEProxy, validatorManagerProxy, oracleManagerProxy, stakingAccountantProxy).

The script assumes the deployer is correct/trusted and does not perform any checks to transfer ownership to a multisig/governance or to verify intended owner.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Misconfiguration of tolerance parameters enabling incorrect validator assessments.\n- Malicious or accidental changes to sanity checker parameters leading to incorrect protocol behavior, loss of funds, or denial of service.\n- If ownership remains with a single key, compromise of that key is high-impact.\n\nVulnerability type: Privilege management / Authorization\nSeverity: medium\nConfidence: 0.7\nLocation: _deploySanityChecker() and _configureSanityChecker()",

This can cause the script to deploy linked contracts against malicious managers, call functions on malicious contracts, or overwrite config entries with attacker-controlled values. On CI or automated deployment environments, an attacker who can tamper with the config could cause on-chain state changes or expose privileged keys to misuse.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Script may call or override state on malicious contracts, enabling protocol manipulation.\n- Write operations (vm.writeJson) may overwrite local config or metadata with attacker-controlled values, leading to subsequent mis-deployments.\n- In automated pipelines with insufficient file integrity checks, this can be exploited to perform unauthorized on-chain actions.\n\nVulnerability type: Configuration / Input validation\nSeverity: medium\nConfidence: 0.8\nLocation: run(), _deploySanityChecker(), _setOracleManagerSanityChecker()",
