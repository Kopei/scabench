      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\n- The library performs ERC20 token transfers (transfer and transferFrom) but does not check return values nor use SafeERC20 wrappers that safely handle non-standard tokens which return false instead of reverting.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- depositUnchecked(LvAsset memory self, address from, uint256 amount)\n- lockUnchecked(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address from)\n- lockFrom(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address from) (calls incLocked then lockUnchecked)\n- unlockTo(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address to)\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- Some ERC20 tokens are non-standard and return false on failed transfers instead of reverting (or behave unexpectedly). Because this code ignores return values, a token's transfer/transferFrom may silently fail while the caller proceeds as if the transfer succeeded. In particular, lockFrom increments the internal locked counter before calling transferFrom. If transferFrom returns false (but does not revert), locked will be increased even though the contract received no tokens.\n\nPotential impact / exploit scenarios:\n- An attacker (or a malicious token contract) can cause the contract to record more locked tokens than it actually holds. Later, the contract could permit unlock/burn/other operations based on the inflated locked counter, leading to inconsistent accounting, failed transfers, or attempts to transfer/burn tokens that the contract does not own. This can lead to loss of funds for honest users, stuck funds, or theft depending on how the higher-level contract uses locked accounting.\n\nVulnerability type: Missing return value checks / unsafe token interaction (ERC20 non-compliance)\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: depositUnchecked(), lockUnchecked(), lockFrom(), unlockTo()",

Many of the library's functions do follow checks-effects-interactions (e.g., incLocked/decLocked happen before external calls), which reduces risk, but depositUnchecked performs a transferFrom without any state change in the library and so could enable reentrancy into the calling contract at an unexpected point in its execution.\n\nPotential impact / exploit scenarios:\n- If the caller contract relies on performing state updates after calling depositUnchecked (or otherwise assumes no reentrancy during token transfers), a malicious token can reenter and manipulate the contract to siphon funds, bypass checks, or corrupt state.

      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\n- The library only parses a 65-byte signature into (v, r, s) but does not validate the cryptographic constraints on v and s. Common required checks are: (1) that s is in the lower half of the secp256k1 curve order (per EIP-2 / EIP-155) to prevent signature malleability, and (2) that v is normalized/within an accepted set (commonly 27 or 28, or normalized from 0/1 to 27/28). The library does none of these checks.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- split(bytes memory raw) and splitUnchecked(bytes memory sig) \u2014 the code only extracts v, r, s and returns them without validation.\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- If a caller uses the output of this library directly in an ecrecover-based authorization check (for example to check that an address signed some message that authorizes spending, minting, or privileged actions), the absence of s- and v-validation allows malformed or malleable signatures to be accepted or to cause ecrecover to behave unexpectedly.\n- An attacker can exploit s-value malleability (provide s' = curveOrder - s) to produce a different signature that still validates unless the consuming contract enforces the low-s rule. This can enable replay across contexts or break uniqueness assumptions.\n- If v is provided as 0/1 (some signing tools emit 0/1) and the consumer expects 27/28 (or vice versa) and does not normalize, ecrecover may return address(0) or an unexpected address. If the consuming contract fails to check for address(0) as an invalid signer, it could lead to unauthorized acceptance or denial-of-service.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Acceptance of malleable signatures can enable replay or duplicate-execution exploits depending on higher-level logic.\n- Incorrect or unnormalized v may cause ecrecover to return address(0), which if not handled properly may enable unauthorized access (if zero-address is treated as allowed) or denial-of-service (valid signatures rejected).\n\nVulnerability type: Input validation / signature malleability\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: split(bytes) and splitUnchecked(bytes) functions",

Many smart contracts (or future EVM changes) require more gas to accept Ether; in those cases transfer will revert and therefore withdraw will revert. That can lock funds for token-holding contracts (or users that receive via smart-contract wallets) making it impossible for them to redeem their DWETH.\n\nPotential impact: Token holders that are smart contracts (or EOAs behind contract-based wallets that need >2300 gas) will be unable to withdraw their ETH; this can lead to funds being effectively locked and a denial-of-service for withdrawals.

Future EVM changes or different calling contexts might change gas propagation semantics. If the code is later modified to use call() (a common change for compatibility), or if EVM behavior evolves, the contract could become vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Although this specific implementation burns the tokens before the external call (which mitigates classic reentrancy-exploit-with-double-withdraw), the pattern is still brittle and may enable subtle future vulnerabilities if the call pattern is changed.\n\nPotential impact: If the code is changed to a forwarding call or EVM semantics change, an attacker could re-enter and cause unexpected behavior or extract funds in a reentrancy scenario.

While this does not directly enable stealing ETH without tokens, it allows manipulation of backing and can enable unexpected value extraction by token holders or manipulators who obtain tokens cheaply.\n\nPotential impact: Economic manipulation: unexpected change in redemptions per token, potential profit for attackers who arrange token ownership and forced ETH inflow.
