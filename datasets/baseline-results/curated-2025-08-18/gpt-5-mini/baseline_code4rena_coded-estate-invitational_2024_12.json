      "title": "Unchecked u64 arithmetic in token count (overflow/underflow)",
      "description": "What it is:\n- The functions increment_tokens() and decrement_tokens() perform plain u64 addition/subtraction without any bounds checks or saturating arithmetic.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- increment_tokens(&self, storage: &mut dyn Storage) -> StdResult<u64>\n- decrement_tokens(&self, storage: &mut dyn Storage) -> StdResult<u64>\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- If token_count is at u64::MAX and increment_tokens() is called, the addition will overflow. In Rust builds without overflow checks (typical release builds / Wasm), integer overflow silently wraps, corrupting the token counter. In builds with overflow checks it will panic, aborting execution.\n- If token_count is 0 and decrement_tokens() is called, subtraction will underflow. In release builds this wraps to a very large value (u64::MAX), corrupting token accounting; in checked builds it panics and reverts execution.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Corruption of the global token_count can lead to duplicate token IDs, unexpected ID reuse, or broken invariants for minting/burning logic implemented elsewhere. That can cause permanent loss or misattribution of tokens, allow minting to create colliding IDs, or otherwise break contract logic.\n- If the operation panics instead of wrapping, an attacker could trigger a panic-induced revert/DoS by calling functionality that leads to decrement at zero.\n\nvulnerability_type: \"integer overflow / integer underflow / unchecked arithmetic\"\nseverity: \"high\"\nconfidence: 0.9\nlocation: \"increment_tokens() and decrement_tokens() functions\" \n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Unchecked Uint128 arithmetic on balances (underflow leading to panic/DoS, overflow/corruption risk)\",\n      \"description\": \"What it is:\\n- increase_balance() and decrease_balance() use Uint128 += and -= operations without explicit checks.

Several public state mutators (set_fee, increase/decrease balance, token count mutators) are exposed here as methods; secure use requires that the surrounding contract logic enforce proper access control and validation. The state file itself does not enforce those constraints, so care must be taken in execute handlers to avoid exposing these operations to untrusted callers. If you want, I can review the execute/handler code to confirm whether proper checks are in place.\ufeff# JSON only response requested originally; above contains JSON plus a trailing note.
