This is inconsistent with the other functions in the interface (add_liquidity and remove_liquidity_imbalance use uint256[2] arrays) and inconsistent with what a 2-token pool implementation would expect.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- remove_liquidity(uint256 _amount, uint256[3] calldata amounts, bool use_underlying) \u2014 file lines 19\u201323 (amounts declared on line 21).\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nSolidity/A\ufeffBI encoding and function selectors are derived from the function signature. If caller contracts use this interface but the actual on-chain Curve pool expects a different signature (for example, uint256[2] instead of uint256[3]), calls will either:\n- revert because the selector doesn't match any function, causing DoS of the caller's functionality; or\n- (in highly unlikely but possible selector-collision scenarios) invoke an unintended function with wrong ABI-decoded arguments.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Denial of service: contracts that rely on this interface may be unable to remove liquidity (calls revert), potentially leaving user funds locked or preventing withdrawals from the pool.\n- If an incorrect selector happens to match another function on the target contract, it could trigger unintended state changes or token transfers, leading to loss of funds.\n\nVulnerability type: ABI / interface mismatch (parameter size/type mismatch)\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: remove_liquidity() function, lines 19\u201323",

Integer division truncation can yield zero for very small rates, causing systems to believe there is no yield when there actually is, potentially stopping distributions or rebalancing flows.\n- The code comment also shows some confusion (comment indicates \"ratePerYear / 1e9 * 100\"), indicating possible ambiguity about the intended conversion.

Even if epochPrice is non-zero but very large, amount * ONE_TRANCHE / epochPrice may evaluate to zero (user receives 0 tranche tokens) due to integer truncation, resulting in economic loss (user's deposited underlyings are spent but they receive zero tokens).
