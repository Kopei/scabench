If this library is used on a different network (testnet, L2, fork) those addresses may either be unused (leading to failed calls) or may be controlled by an attacker who deployed contracts at the same addresses on that chain. Additionally, if an external protocol upgrades or the trusted address needs to change (e.g., due to a compromise), those constants cannot be updated without redeploying dependent contracts, preventing timely mitigation.\nPotential impact: Funds or tokens sent to these addresses (or interactions routed through them) can be lost or intercepted if the addresses are incorrect or attacker-controlled on the deployed chain. In a compromised or upgraded external protocol scenario, use of immutable addresses prevents emergency migration or patching, which can lead to prolonged fund exposure or service disruption.\nVulnerability type: External dependency / configuration hardcoding / destination address trust\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: LaunchPadUtils.sol \u2014 WETH (line 16), CURVE_STABLE_NG_FACTORY (line 18), UNISWAP_POOL_FACTORY_ (line 21), UNISWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS (line 24)",
