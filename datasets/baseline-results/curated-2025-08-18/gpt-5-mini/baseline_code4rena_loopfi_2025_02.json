      "description": "What: _delegateCall uses delegatecall which runs code in the context of the calling contract. If the calling (higher-level) function performs the delegatecall before making all necessary state updates and there is no reentrancy protection, the callee's code can reenter the contract and manipulate state.\nWhere: _delegateCall(address to, bytes memory data) in BaseAction.sol (called from user/contract flows that use this helper)\nWhy it's an issue: Delegatecall executes arbitrary code with the same storage layout and msg.sender context. If used during a multi-step operation where state is updated after the delegatecall, the callee can reenter and observe/modify intermediate state, causing double-withdrawals, incorrect accounting updates, or other inconsistent state transitions.\nPotential impact: Loss of funds (double-spend, unauthorized transfers), corrupted accounting, denial of service or logic bypass.\nVulnerability type: Reentrancy\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.9\nlocation: \"_delegateCall() function, BaseAction.sol (and any caller that invokes it without reentrancy guards)\"",

      "description": "What: _delegateCall does not validate that the 'to' address contains contract code (e.g., extcodesize > 0) or is not address(0). Delegatecalling an EOA or an address with no code will cause the delegatecall to fail (often returning false and empty return data), which _delegateCall then reverts.\nWhere: _delegateCall(address to, bytes memory data) in BaseAction.sol\nWhy it's an issue: If callers accept a 'to' address from external or otherwise manipulable sources, an attacker can set 'to' to an address without code (or to a contract that was selfdestructed) and cause delegatecall to fail and revert. This can be used to intentionally break functionality or cause denial of service for flows that rely on successful calls.\nPotential impact: Denial of service for operations that rely on _delegateCall; inability to perform critical actions if an attacker can force delegatecall to a non-contract (or a destroyed contract).\nVulnerability type: Denial of service (missing input validation)\nSeverity: medium\nConfidence: 0.8\nlocation: \"_delegateCall() function, BaseAction.sol\"",

This transparently rethrows the callee's revert data.\nWhere: _revertBytes(bytes memory errMsg) and its use in _delegateCall() in BaseAction.sol\nWhy it's an issue: Returning raw revert data from a delegatecall can leak internal implementation details or sensitive debugging strings from the callee. Additionally, carefully crafted revert payloads could be used to confuse callers that decode revert reasons in a specific format or to trigger certain behavior in tooling or other contracts that interpret revert data. While rethrowing is a common pattern, it should be done with awareness of information disclosure and consistency.\nPotential impact: Information disclosure of internal error messages and implementation details; potential confusion or incompatibility with callers that expect specific revert formats.\nVulnerability type: Information disclosure / error-handling\nSeverity: low\nConfidence: 0.6\nlocation: \"_revertBytes() function and its invocation in _delegateCall(), BaseAction.sol\"",
