More importantly, if the token implements permit incorrectly/maliciously (e.g., does side effects then reverts, or pretends to succeed), the contract does not validate that the expected allowance change happened before proceeding, which can lead to unexpected behavior, failed operations, or reliance on previous approvals in ways that can be abused.\n\n- Potential impact: UX failures causing unexpected reverts (user funds not staked but transaction progressed), or in conjunction with a malicious token contract could enable surprising side effects or make it easier for an attacker to hide malicious behaviour (because errors are ignored).\n",

The code assumes the token's permit succeeded, but because the permit call is loosely handled (try/catch + no post-check), a malicious or non-standard token that returns/behaves incorrectly could cause the subsequent _stake/_stakeMore to behave unexpectedly.\n\n- What the vulnerability is: The contract trusts the token's permit to have set the allowance without validating it (e.g., by checking allowance(owner, address(this)) >= _amount). This opens a class of issues when interacting with non-standard or malicious tokens.\n\n- Where it occurs: Immediately after the permit(...) try/catch in permitAndStake(...) and permitAndStakeMore(...), before calling _stake/_stakeMore.\n\n- Why it's a security issue: If permit does not actually set the allowance (malicious token), then the subsequent _stake may revert or, depending on the token behavior, transferFrom might succeed in unexpected ways (if the token ignores allowances). Not verifying the effect also makes it easier for an attacker to craft a token that pretends to accept permits but does not set allowances or performs side-effects.\n\n- Potential impact: Failed/stuck staking operations, or interacts incorrectly with non-standard token implementations which can result in loss of funds, incorrect accounting, or atomic failures where users believe they staked but did not.\n",
