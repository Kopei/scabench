It also deviates from the common pattern where implementation remains uninitialized and only proxies are initialized.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Low/Informational: Mostly a deployment/misconfiguration risk.

Because there is no try/catch or sanity checks, any revert from configure will revert the whole initialization call (DoS), and any unexpected side effects are not mitigated.\nPotential impact: Denial of service during initialization (if configure reverts).

While this function is onlyOwner, a mistaken or malicious transaction from the owner (or a compromised owner account) can revert the call, potentially interfering with operational flows that expect successful configuration changes. Additionally, unexpected reverts during configuration could be used to block upgrades or intended setups.\nPotential impact: Denial-of-service for owner configuration operations (owner must re-submit with correct lengths). If relying code expects updates to be atomic, repeated reverts could hamper protocol operation. Because it's owner-only, direct attacker exploitation is limited to owner compromise or accidental misuse.\n",

In Solidity 0.8+, underflow causes a revert, which would break the toggleOperator call. Using uint256 for a boolean flag and computing 1 - oldValue is fragile compared to using a bool or explicit branching.\nPotential impact: If storage contains unexpected values, toggling operators can revert, causing denial-of-service for operator toggling. In the presence of a storage write bug elsewhere (or if contract is extended), this could become exploitable.\n",

It does not verify any Merkle proofs or enforce limits, nor does it perform transfers. If this mock were ever used in production or if its logic is assumed to be authoritative by other contracts, the absence of verification could enable unauthorized claims, double claims, or emission of misleading events.

Although the proxy sets the implementation slot later, reentrancy from the factory can cause nested delegatecalls executing arbitrary implementation code under conditions the proxy author did not intend.
