Why it's a security issue: The contract transfers and approves a scaled (generally smaller) amount of collateral but requests the full (unscaled) mint amount from the minter.

      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\nThe boostPrice() view function computes price using exponentiation and large multiplications: sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 and multiplication by 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS). Depending on constants (decimals and PRICE_DECIMALS) this intermediate arithmetic can overflow uint256 and revert.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- boostPrice() \u2014 multiple expressions using sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 and multiplication by powers of 10\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nAlthough view functions do not directly move funds, a reverting view can break callers that expect a price value (strategies, checks, other contracts). Also if some other on-chain logic depends on boostPrice() and does not handle revert, it can cause DoS for operations that need the price.\n\nPotential impact:\n- DoS of dependent operations that call boostPrice().\n- Unexpected reverts if constants are changed or if sqrtPriceX96 reaches extreme values.\n\nVulnerability type: integer overflow (arithmetic)\nSeverity: low\nConfidence: 0.5\nLocation: boostPrice()",
