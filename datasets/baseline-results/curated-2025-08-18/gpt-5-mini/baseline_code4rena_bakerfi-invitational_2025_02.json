The repay call will repay the full debt (assetsRepaid == repaidAmount). The subsequent check if (assetsRepaid < amount) revert FailedToRepayDebt(); will evaluate to true (repaidAmount < provided amount) and revert the transaction even though the underlying repay succeeded. This makes certain repay calls fail unexpectedly.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Failed repayments and unexpected reverts during deleveraging or position close operations.\n- Loss of liveness: users/governance might be unable to fully repay/close positions when passing an amount greater than the outstanding debt, potentially leading to locked capital or inability to withdraw.\n- If higher-level flows rely on _repay to partially/fully unwind positions, those flows may be broken or revert, potentially causing losses or stuck positions.\n\nVulnerability type: Logic / Validation bug\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: _repay() function",

While reentrancy into a contract under construction is limited (the contract code is not yet available via extcodesize), some malicious token implementations attempt to perform complex behaviors in approve/asset that could influence deployment or cause revert/DoS.\n\n- Where it occurs: constructor lines that call IERC4626(vault_).asset() and ERC20(asset_).safeApprove(...).\n\n- Why it's a security issue: A malicious token or vault could cause the constructor to revert (preventing deployment) or perform unexpected side effects during deployment.

      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\nThe internal initializer _initializeGovernableOwnable accepts an initialGovernor address and calls _transferGovernorship(initialGovernor) without validating that the address is non-zero. Meanwhile, the external transferGovernorship function forbids setting a zero address (reverting on address(0)). This mismatch allows a contract to be initialized with governor == address(0). Once the governor is address(0), no one can call functions protected by onlyGovernor, and transferGovernorship cannot be used to set a valid governor because onlyGovernor requires msg.sender == governor() and governor() == address(0) rejects all callers.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- _initializeGovernableOwnable(address initialOwner, address initialGovernor) (initialization path)\n- transferGovernorship(address _newGovernor) (validation that prevents later recovery)\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nIf a deployer (or a mistaken initializer call) sets initialGovernor to address(0), the contract will have no functional governor and there is no way to recover governorship via the public API. This is an availability/administration failure for any functionality gated to the governor role. It is an especially high-risk issue for upgradeable contracts or contracts where important administrative functions are restricted to the governor.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Permanent denial of service for all governor-only functions.\n- Inability to update configuration, emergency parameters, or perform administrative actions reserved to the governor.\n- If critical safety or upgrade operations require the governor, the protocol could be irreversibly crippled.\n\nvulnerability_type: \"access control / initialization\"\nseverity: \"high\"\nconfidence: 0.9\nlocation: \"_initializeGovernableOwnable() and transferGovernorship() functions\"",

Using >= 0 does not distinguish between an intentionally set non-negative price and an uninitialized default of 0. Consumers calling these functions may receive a price of 0 (and publishTime 0) for a feed that doesn't actually exist or hasn't been set up. That can be misinterpreted by downstream logic.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Downstream contracts or systems that don't guard against zero prices may behave incorrectly: e.g., division by a very small price, minting/borrowing decisions based on price 0, or other accounting errors leading to financial loss or denial-of-service for legitimate users.

If the initial price for a feed is accidentally zero or if some flow sets an existing feed's price to zero, updates for that feed will be ignored. That can prevent legitimate price updates from being applied.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Denial of service to add new feeds through updates.

An attacker controlling a strategy or its upgrade path can drain the entire asset balance from the vault.\n\nNotes / mitigations: Avoid granting unbounded allowances. Prefer pull/push patterns that do not rely on strategies calling transferFrom on the vault, or use per-deposit allowances, limit allowances to the expected amount, or use ERC20safeIncrease/safeDecrease patterns and set allowance back to zero when not needed.
