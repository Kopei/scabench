      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\nThe public function setTrustedForwarder(address) can be called by any external account. There is no access control (owner/onlyAdmin/etc.) restricting who can set the trusted forwarder.\n\nWhere it occurs:\nFunction: setTrustedForwarder(address trustedForwarder)\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nThe contract trusts a single address as a trusted forwarder and changes behavior (see _msgSender / _msgData) when txn originates from that forwarder. Allowing any caller to set that trusted forwarder means an attacker can designate themselves (or any malicious contract) as the trusted forwarder and thereby influence how the contract interprets the true sender of messages.\n\nPotential impact:\nAn attacker who sets themselves as trusted forwarder can exploit the meta-transaction logic to manipulate _msgSender/_msgData (see the next finding). This can lead to unauthorized token transfers, privilege escalation, or other actions that treat an attacker-provided address as the original caller. At minimum it breaks the security model of meta-transactions and can lead to immediate compromise of token balances and approvals.\n\nVulnerability type: Access control / Authorization\nSeverity: critical\nConfidence: 0.98\nLocation: setTrustedForwarder() function (public, in ERC20MetaTxUpgradeable.sol)",

      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\nThe contract's _msgSender() override treats msg.sender equal to the trusted forwarder as a special case and extracts the original sender address from the last 20 bytes of calldata (assembly shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))). When a trusted forwarder is controlled by an attacker they can craft calldata so that _msgSender() returns any arbitrary address.\n\nWhere it occurs:\nFunction: _msgSender() (assembly block) and related meta-tx handling in _msgData()\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nERC20 functions (transfer, approve, transferFrom, etc.) and other application logic rely on _msgSender() to determine transaction origin. If _msgSender() can be controlled by a malicious forwarder, the attacker can cause the contract to treat arbitrary addresses as the caller. For example, a malicious forwarder could call transfer(recipient, amount) and append a victim's address in the calldata; _msgSender() would return the victim's address and the token transfer would debit the victim's balance without their consent.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Immediate unauthorized transfers and theft of tokens from victim accounts.\n- Approvals / other privileged actions could be performed as if by victims.\n- Complete break of authorization assumptions for any function using _msgSender().\n\nVulnerability type: Authorization / Forwarder trust / Caller impersonation\nSeverity: critical\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: _msgSender() override and _msgData() override (ERC20MetaTxUpgradeable.sol)",

The internal _useNonce increments the nonce map immediately and returns the previous value. The contract increments the user's nonce before verifying the signature.\n\nWhere it occurs:\nFunctions: permit(...), transferWithAuthorization(...)\nSpecific code pattern: using _useNonce(owner) / _useNonce(holder) inside the structHash computation before ECDSA.recover and signature validation.\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\nBecause _useNonce increments the nonce before signature verification, an attacker can call permit/transferWithAuthorization with arbitrary (invalid) signature values to consume the current nonce of the target owner/holder. This will make any legitimately-signed meta-transaction that used that nonce invalid afterwards (nonce has been consumed). In other words, nonces can be prematurely and maliciously burned without verifying the signature.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Denial of Service: legitimate off-chain-signed permits or transferWithAuthorization requests can be invalidated by an attacker calling the functions with bad signatures to consume nonces.\n- User experience and integration breakage for platforms relying on those meta-tx flows.\n\nVulnerability type: Logical bug / Replay/DoS via nonce handling\nSeverity: high\nConfidence: 0.95\nLocation: permit() and transferWithAuthorization() functions (use of _useNonce(...) before signature verification)",

      "title": "External call to token contract without reentrancy guard",
      "description": "What the vulnerability is:\nThe contract performs an external low-level call to the token contract (req.to.call(...)) then, after that call returns, calls _eurf.payGaslessBasefee(req.from, _msgSender()). There is no reentrancy guard in the Forwarder contract.\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- execute() function \u2014 the low-level call is at the line that performs (success, ret) = req.to.call{gas: req.gas, value: req.value}(abi.encodePacked(req.data, req.from)); and the subsequent call to _eurf.payGaslessBasefee(req.from, _msgSender()) happens immediately after that.\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- Because the contract calls an external, potentially untrusted token contract (even though req.to is required to equal _eurfAddress, the token contract itself may be malicious or upgraded to malicious behavior), that external call can re-enter the Forwarder contract while the call stack is still in execute(). Even though the contract increments the nonce before making the external call (so a direct replay of the same meta-tx by the same signer is prevented), reentrancy can still be used to call other functions on Forwarder or to manipulate the token contract state in unexpected ways.\n- In particular, if the token's transfer implementation calls back into Forwarder (or into _eurf.payGaslessBasefee via some path), it may change token state or bookkeeping in a way that causes inconsistent accounting or trick the contract into paying multiple base-fee reimbursements or otherwise manipulating side effects. The forwarder calls _eurf.payGaslessBasefee after the token transfer; a malicious token could reenter to modify data that payGaslessBasefee relies on.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Depending on the token contract implementation and payGaslessBasefee logic, this can lead to double-payments, incorrect fee reimbursements, drained funds, or other invariants being violated.\n\nvulnerability_type: \"reentrancy\",\nseverity: \"high\",\nconfidence: 0.7,\nlocation: \"execute() around the low-level call and subsequent _eurf.payGaslessBasefee call\" \n    \n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Appending signer bytes to calldata can cause unexpected token behavior or unintended argument interpretation\",\n    \"description\": \"What the vulnerability is:\\nThe execute() function forwards the original req.data but appends req.from to the encoded calldata: abi.encodePacked(req.data, req.from).

Standard ERC\u201120 implementations normally ignore trailing calldata, but non-standard or malicious token implementations (or tokens that implement token callbacks/extensions like ERC677/ERC1363/others) may parse or interpret the extra bytes, or behave differently when extra data is present. That can change the semantics of the transport and lead to unintended token transfers, invocation of alternate code paths, or additional side effects performed by the token.\\n- The contract assumes appending req.from is safe/harmless; that assumption does not hold for all token implementations. A malicious or nonstandard token could exploit that extra data to manipulate balances, call back into Forwarder, or otherwise cause loss of funds or incorrect accounting.\\n\\nPotential impact:\\n- Loss of funds, unexpected token transfers, triggering alternate token code paths, or facilitating complex reentrancy/contract-manipulation attacks mediated by the extra calldata.\\n\nvulnerability_type: \"unexpected calldata / contract interaction\",\nseverity: \"high\",\nconfidence: 0.8,\nlocation: \"execute() call where calldata is constructed with abi.encodePacked(req.data, req.from)\" \n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Unbounded caller-supplied gas parameter can be used to grief relayers (DoS) or provoke unexpected behavior\",\n    \"description\": \"What the vulnerability is:\\nThe contract uses the caller-supplied req.gas value to set the gas forwarded to the token call (req.to.call{gas: req.gas, ...}). The relayer (the caller of execute) pays for the entire transaction, but the forwarded gas is controlled by the signed request.\\n\\nWhere it occurs:\\n- execute(): req.to.call{gas: req.gas, value: req.value}(...);\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\\n- A signed request authorizes a relayer to execute code with the exact gas amount included in the request. A malicious signer (or an attacker who obtains a signature) can specify a gas amount that causes the token call to fail or to consume unexpected amounts of gas, causing the execute() to revert and the relayer to lose their submitted gas fees. Even for honest signers, passing an overly large or small gas value may cause the relayer to be unable or unwilling to execute the request.\\n- Because the contract uses the raw req.gas value without bounding or validation, the signed request can be constructed to intentionally make execution fail for the relayer (denial-of-service of that meta-transaction) or to produce other unexpected behavior in the callee by starving or over-provisioning gas.\n\nPotential impact:\\n- Denial-of-service of meta-transactions (relayers will refuse to execute requests that can be crafted to fail or waste gas). Relayers might be tricked into paying gas for failing transactions causing financial loss to relayers.

An attacker (or even the signer inadvertently) can craft such a request to cause relayers to be unable to process the request. This is effectively a denial-of-service for that meta-transaction.\\n\nPotential impact:\\n- DoS of a meta-transaction; relayers cannot verify or execute such requests. If frontends or automation blindly submit these requests, it can lead to repeated revert and gas waste.

The _getEncoded function itself returns abi.encodePacked(requestTypeHash, abi.encode(...), suffixData). Using abi.encodePacked for constructing the preimage (concatenating dynamic elements) can produce encodings that are ambiguous or may be malleable if suffixData is attacker-controlled or if field encodings are not uniquely separable.\n\nWhere it occurs:\\n- _verifySig() calls keccak256(_getEncoded(...)) where _getEncoded uses abi.encodePacked(requestTypeHash, abi.encode(...), suffixData).\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\\n- EIP\u2011712 canonical encoding uses abi.encode (not abi.encodePacked) for composing the typehash and struct members into the structHash (i.e., abi.encode(typeHash, ...)). Using abi.encodePacked can make the byte concatenation ambiguous for certain inputs and dynamic suffixes. A crafted suffixData could potentially make two different (requestTypeHash, struct fields, suffixData) triples hash to the same value under abi.encodePacked concatenation or cause a mismatch between off-chain signer expectations and on-chain verification, enabling signature replay or misuse of signatures across different intended payloads.\n\nPotential impact:\\n- An attacker might be able to manipulate suffixData or craft messages that collide under the packed encoding and thus reuse a signature to authorize a different request, leading to unauthorized token transfers or other privileged actions. At minimum it deviates from the EIP\u2011712 specification and increases the risk of signature ambiguity.\\n\nvulnerability_type: \"signature malleability / encoding ambiguity\",\nseverity: \"medium\",\nconfidence: 0.6,\nlocation: \"_getEncoded() and _verifySig() (construction of the EIP-712 struct hash using abi.encodePacked)\" \n  }\n]\n} Technical Note: The findings above focus on real security risks that may lead to fund loss, DoS or protocol manipulation.
