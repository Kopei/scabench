      "title": "Silent truncation/incorrect result in 512-by-256 division when quotient does not fit in 256 bits",
      "description": "The function div512x256 computes the division of a 512-bit numerator (a1:a0) by a 256-bit denominator b under the stated precondition that the result fits into 256 bits. However, this precondition is not enforced. When the true quotient exceeds 256 bits, the function returns a silently truncated value (effectively the result modulo 2^256), without reverting or signaling an error. For example, with b = 1 and a1 > 0, the correct quotient is (a1 << 256) | a0, but the function returns only a0 (after the normalization path, it ultimately sets r := mul(a0, inv) with inv = 1 when b = 1). This leads to incorrect arithmetic that can corrupt protocol accounting or allow value manipulation in callers that rely on this library for exact arithmetic.",

      "description": "In the sqrt function, the assembly block checks for zero input and executes the STOP opcode: `if iszero(a) { stop() }`. STOP terminates the entire execution context successfully and immediately, not just the function. This means any contract calling sqrt may have its execution halted before finishing critical logic, without reverting. As a result, prior state changes persist and subsequent checks/transfers are skipped. This can be exploited to force early exits, causing denial of service, skipped invariants, or inconsistent state (e.g., partial updates without corresponding transfers).",

If a caller provides an out-of-range exponent, the left-shifted value can overflow the 14-bit exponent field and spill into adjacent bits (e.g., the mantissa sign bit or the L-flag), corrupting the packed representation. This can flip the sign, incorrectly mark L/M mantissa size, or otherwise create malformed floats. Downstream arithmetic and comparisons will then produce incorrect results, potentially enabling protocol manipulation or data corruption when such values are used for financial calculations.",

      "description": "Many operations assume the mantissa has at most 38 (M) or 72 (L) digits. However, the library functions (add, sub, sqrt, comparisons, etc.) accept arbitrary packedFloat values without validating mantissa magnitude against the L-flag. An attacker can supply a non-canonical packedFloat with a very large mantissa (up to 242 bits due to MANTISSA_MASK). The code frequently multiplies mantissas by large powers of 10 in assembly, e.g., `aMan := mul(aMan, BASE_TO_THE_MAX_DIGITS_M)` or `aMan := mul(aMan, BASE_TO_THE_DIGIT_DIFF)`. With forged oversized mantissas, these multiplications can overflow 256-bit arithmetic in assembly and silently wrap modulo 2^256, producing unpredictable and incorrect results. This can corrupt calculations (e.g., comparisons, sums, sqrt pre-scaling), potentially leading to broken invariants and loss of funds in protocols that accept user-supplied packedFloat inputs.",

In Yul, arithmetic wraps modulo 2^256 instead of reverting on overflow. If ln() (or these helpers directly) are called with an out-of-range or unnormalized mantissa, intermediate multiplications like mul(9, mantissa) can overflow and wrap, producing corrupted results instead of reverting. This occurs in the assembly blocks inside calculateQ2 (q2 == 5, q2 == 6, q2 == 7 branches) and calculateQ3 (q3 == 4, q3 == 5, q3 == 6, q3 == 7 branches). Because these functions are public and ln() performs no input normalization/validation, a caller can craft inputs that cause wrapped arithmetic.
