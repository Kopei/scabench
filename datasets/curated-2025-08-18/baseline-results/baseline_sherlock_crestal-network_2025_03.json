Why this is an issue: A signature intended for deployment creation can be reused for configuration updates, and because the requestID is not bound in the signed data, the same signature can be applied to any request owned by the signer for that project. Potential impact: Unintended authorization scope and replay across actions, allowing third parties possessing a valid signature to perform different actions than intended (event-level and config manipulation).
