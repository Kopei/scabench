This allows a malicious user to inflate their recorded deposit (by using a fee-on-transfer or deflationary token) to claim disproportionately large rewardToken/veNFT amounts, potentially draining the rewardToken pool. Additionally, caps (UserDepositCap and TotalDepositCap) are enforced against the inflated recorded values rather than the actual received funds, which can lead to inconsistent state and economic loss.\n- Where: deposit() function, lines around the safeTransferFrom call and subsequent state updates (transfer happens before accounting and accounting uses amount_ directly).\n- Why it's a security issue: Attackers can cause the contract to over-credit deposits and later claim excessive rewards, leading to loss of reward tokens and protocol funds.\n- Potential impact: Loss of funds (rewardToken) due to overpayment; broken cap enforcement and distorted totalDeposited metrics.",

Specifically, the function sets the user's LockedBalance.amount to newBalance_ but only reduces the managed NFT's amount by min(newBalance_, managed.amount). If newBalance_ exceeds the managed NFT's recorded amount, the user's locked amount is effectively increased out of thin air. Later, the user can withdraw this inflated amount via withdraw(), which transfers ERC20 tokens from the contract balance, potentially draining funds deposited by other users.\n\nWhere:\n- Function: onDettachFromManagedNFT(uint256 tokenId_, uint256 managedTokenId_, uint256 newBalance_)\n- Code snippets of concern:\n  - Sets user's locked amount directly: _updateNftLocked(tokenId_, LockedBalance(amount, maxUnlockTimestamp, false)) where amount = int128(newBalance_)\n  - Reduces managed amount by min(amount, managed.amount): newManagedLocked.amount -= amount < newManagedLocked.amount ? amount : newManagedLocked.amount\n  - No check that newBalance_ <= managed NFT's locked amount\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- The total ERC20 tokens held by the contract are conserved, but the internal accounting for a user's LockedBalance can be arbitrarily increased by the managedNFTManager. Since withdraw() transfers ERC20 tokens equal to the user's LockedBalance.amount, a malicious or compromised manager can inflate a user's locked amount and then have the user withdraw, stealing tokens from the contract (i.e., from other users\u2019 deposits).\n\nPotential impact:\n- Loss of funds from the contract as users withdraw more tokens than were actually moved from the managed NFT, enabling theft and draining of the escrowed ERC20 token pool.\n\nNotes:\n- This is not mitigated by the supply variable, as onAttach/onDettach update LockedBalance via _updateNftLocked without adjusting the supply variable or transferring tokens. Thus, accounting becomes inconsistent and enables draining via withdraw().\n\nRecommended fix:\n- Enforce strict conservation in onDettachFromManagedNFT by requiring newBalance_ <= nftStates[managedTokenId_].locked.amount and reverting otherwise.\n- Alternatively, compute the detachable amount from managedLocked and ignore the provided newBalance_, or adjust both sides symmetrically and update any global supply/accounting consistently.",
