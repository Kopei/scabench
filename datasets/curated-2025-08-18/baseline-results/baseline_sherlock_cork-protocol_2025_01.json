In a UUPSUpgradeable contract, initialize must be called via the proxy (i.e., via delegatecall) to set the proxy's storage (owner, router addresses, etc.). The notDelegated modifier forbids delegatecall, making initialize callable only on the implementation contract, not on the proxy. As a result, when deployed behind a proxy, the proxy cannot be initialized: owner remains the zero address, univ2Router is unset, and all onlyOwner-gated configuration (e.g., onNewIssuance, addReserve, emptyReserve, upgrades) becomes unusable. This effectively bricks the proxy and the protocol functionality, constituting a denial of service.",

The missing decrements should occur in __redeemExcessFromAmmPool() (and/or redeem()).\nWhy: This breaks core accounting invariants. The user receives RA and PA corresponding to the attributed withdrawal portion without the withdrawal pool state reflecting the payout, enabling the same liquidity to be redeemed again by others and causing the global attributed LV (atrributedLv) to remain overstated.\nImpact: Double-spend/loss of funds and eventual insolvency. Future operations that rely on correct balances/exchange rates (e.g., reserve(), subsequent redeem()) can misallocate funds or revert due to underflows/insufficient balances.\nFix: In __redeemExcessFromAmmPool(), first redeem the attributed portion from the withdrawal pool using __redeemfromWithdrawalPool(self, amountAttributed) (which correctly decrements atrributedLv and pool balances) and then handle the AMM excess by subtracting withdrawnFromAmm from ammLiquidityPool.balance.

Specifically: emptyReservePartial() calls self.ds[dsId].ds.transfer(to, amount) before decrementing self.ds[dsId].reserve; emptyReserve() delegates to emptyReservePartial(); addReserve() calls self.ds[dsId].ds.transferFrom(from, address(this), amount) before incrementing self.ds[dsId].reserve. Because these calls invoke external contracts (the DS token), a malicious or non-standard token can reenter the calling contract during transfer/transferFrom (e.g., via arbitrary callbacks in a custom ERC20, ERC777 hooks, or direct calls within token code). Since state updates occur after the transfer, reentrancy can observe stale reserve values or trigger other sensitive actions that assume the reserve was already updated. Potential impacts include double-spend/drain attempts on linked logic that uses the reserve value, premature or repeated withdrawals, or bypassing invariants in the calling contract if it lacks a reentrancy guard. While a standard ERC20 DS token limits direct drains, the external call-before-effects pattern is unsafe and exposes the integrating contract to reentrancy if any invoked token or recipient is malicious.",

On networks or forks that have not activated EIP-1153 (pre-Cancun or certain L2s/sidechains), these opcodes are invalid and will cause runtime reverts. Any contract function that uses this library would then be unusable, effectively causing a denial of service. This occurs in the assembly blocks of acquire(), release(), and acquired(). While acceptable on chains that support EIP-1153, deploying to unsupported environments leads to predictable DoS.",
