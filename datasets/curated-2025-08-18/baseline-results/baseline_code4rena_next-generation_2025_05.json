      "title": "Missing EIP-712 domain binding allows cross-domain signature replay",
      "description": "The contract accepts an arbitrary EIP-712 domainSeparator provided by the caller when verifying signatures. In _verifySig(), the digest is computed as keccak256(\"\\x19\\x01\" || domainSeparator || keccak256(_getEncoded(...))). Because domainSeparator is not tied to this contract (e.g., verifyingContract = address(this), chainId = block.chainid), any signature produced for the same structured data under a different domain (another contract address or chain) will be considered valid here if the nonce matches. This issue occurs in _verifySig(...) and is reachable via verify(...) and execute(...), which both take domainSeparator as a parameter and pass it unvalidated to _verifySig(). Security impact: An attacker can reuse a signature a user signed for a different forwarder or on a different chain (with the same request fields and a matching nonce, e.g., 0 for first-time use) to execute a token transfer via this forwarder. As execute() only enforces req.to == _eurfAddress and the selector == transfer(address,uint256), a victim\u2019s previously signed request can be replayed here, causing unintended EURF token transfers.",

      "description": "The contract exposes public setters for critical economic parameters without any access control. Specifically, setFeeFaucet(), setTxFeeRate(), and setGaslessBasefee() are public and can be called by anyone. This allows any external account to change the fee recipient (_feesFaucet) and fee parameters (_txfeeRate and _gaslessBasefee). If this abstract contract is used as-is or the child contract does not override these functions with proper access control, an attacker can redirect fees to their own address, set the transaction fee to 100% (newTxFeeRate = 10000), or set an arbitrarily large base fee for gasless transactions. This can lead to theft of funds, denial of service, and protocol manipulation. Where: setFeeFaucet() (lines within the FeesHandlerUpgradeable contract), setTxFeeRate() (same), setGaslessBasefee() (same). Why: Missing modifiers like onlyOwner/onlyAdmin on state-changing functions that control monetary flows. Impact: - Redirect all fees to attacker-controlled address. - Set fee rate to confiscate user funds (e.g., 100% fee). - Make gasless transactions economically impossible by setting exorbitant base fees.",

As a result, all administrative functions that rely on AccessControl (grantRole/revokeRole) are unusable because no account has the admin required to manage roles, add/remove controllers, or set a valid master minter. In practice, this bricks core functionality: - addController/removeController and setMasterMinter rely on grantRole/revokeRole which require the caller to have the admin role; no such account exists. - MINTER_ROLE cannot be granted because its admin is MASTER_MINTER, but MASTER_MINTER is assigned to address(0) (which cannot transact). - mint/burn cannot be used because no valid minter or master minter exists.

Where: adminSanity() and forceTransfer() functions; missing override of ERC20Upgradeable transfer/update paths (_update). Why: This is a broken authorization/enforcement logic; security controls are effectively dead code for normal operations.

An attacker can then call ERC20 functions (e.g., transfer, approve) from their forwarder and append any victim address to calldata, making the contract believe the victim is the caller. This enables unauthorized transfers from victims' balances and bypasses access controls in derived contracts that rely on _msgSender() (e.g., onlyOwner/roles), leading to loss of funds and privilege escalation. Additionally, if the attacker omits the 20-byte suffix, _msgSender() becomes address(0), which can cause unexpected behavior in contracts that do not defensively check for zero addresses.",
