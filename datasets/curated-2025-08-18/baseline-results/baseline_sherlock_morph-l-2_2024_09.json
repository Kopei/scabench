This defeats the determinism the function aims to provide and can lead to inconsistent outputs across executions. This occurs in replaceType(), where it loops `for oldType, newType := range typeRemappings` and uses strings.Contains/strings.Replace on the first encountered match. While sortedOldTypes is used earlier to construct typeRemappings deterministically, iteration over typeRemappings in replaceType is still non-deterministic.

This check is ineffective because common.Address is always 20 bytes; invalid or empty inputs are converted to the zero address (0x000...00), and len(Bytes()) remains 20. As a result, providing an empty or malformed address via CLI flags silently sets critical addresses (L2CrossDomainMessenger, Sequencer, Gov) to the zero address.\n\nWhere:\n- SetCliContext(), checks for:\n  - flags.L2CrossDomainMessengerContractAddr: after common.HexToAddress(...), followed by if len(c.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddress.Bytes()) == 0 { ... }\n  - flags.L2SequencerAddr: after common.HexToAddress(...), followed by if len(c.SequencerAddress.Bytes()) == 0 { ... }\n  - flags.GovAddr: after common.HexToAddress(...), followed by if len(c.GovAddress.Bytes()) == 0 { ... }\n\nWhy it's a security issue:\n- Misconfigured critical authority addresses to the zero address can cause denial of service (no valid signer can satisfy permission checks) or, depending on downstream logic, unintended open access if zero address is treated specially. It also silently overrides safe defaults, increasing the risk of operating with insecure or non-functional governance/sequencer settings.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Denial of service in sequencing or governance operations.\n- Unauthorized protocol actions if zero address bypasses checks in downstream components.\n- Protocol manipulation via misconfiguration.\n\nRecommended fix:\n- Validate the input string with common.IsHexAddress before converting, and reject invalid/empty inputs.\n- Additionally, explicitly reject the zero address: if addr == (common.Address{}) { return error }. Example:\n  - s := strings.TrimSpace(ctx.GlobalString(...)); if !common.IsHexAddress(s) { return error }; addr := common.HexToAddress(s); if addr == (common.Address{}) { return error }.",
