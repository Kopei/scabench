In _getExchangeRate() and getExchangeRate(), the code calls oracles[tokenIn].currentValue() and oracles[tokenOut].currentValue() without checking that an oracle is registered (non-zero address) or that priceOut is non-zero, leading to a call to address(0) (which reverts) or a division by zero. In checkMinOrderSize(), oracles[tokenIn].currentValue() is also called without a zero-address check. Delisting a token (oracle set to address(0)) or an oracle returning 0 will make these functions revert, potentially breaking order creation/validation and any dependent automation. This can be exploited by a faulty/malicious oracle or by misconfiguration, causing system-wide outages for affected tokens.",

      "description": "adjustForDecimals() computes 10 ** (decimalOut - decimalIn) when aligning token scales. If a listed token reports an extreme decimals value (e.g., malicious/non-standard ERC20 returning a large uint8), the exponentiation can overflow uint256 in Solidity 0.8 and revert. This function is used by getMinAmountReceived(), so orders involving such tokens (if listed) will consistently revert, causing a denial of service for those pairs. While typical tokens use 0\u201318 decimals, the absence of bounds checking allows a single misconfigured or malicious token listing to disrupt protocol functionality for those pairs.",

If the oracle ever provides a negative price (due to feed error or manipulation), casting int64 -> uint64 will wrap the value into a very large positive number. This occurs in currentValue() and updatePrice(). As a result, consumers of this oracle may receive massively inflated prices, enabling manipulation of collateral valuations, borrow limits, or trade execution that depends on this price.\n- Where: currentValue() return at line 31; updatePrice() assignment at line 45\n- Why it's a security issue: Negative values wrap to large unsigned integers, breaking invariant assumptions that prices are positive and reasonably bounded.\n- Potential impact: Severe mispricing, protocol manipulation, under-collateralized positions, and potential loss of funds for protocols relying on this oracle output.",
