      "title": "Unchecked ERC20 transfer return value in rescue may fail silently and leave funds stuck",
      "description": "The rescue function calls ERC20 transfer without checking its return value and without using a SafeERC20 pattern. Some tokens return false instead of reverting on failure, causing the function to succeed without actually transferring tokens, potentially leaving funds stuck and creating operational ambiguity.\n\nWhere: rescue(address _token), line 29.\nWhy it's a security issue: Silent failures can prevent recovery of tokens and mislead operators into believing transfers succeeded.\nPotential impact: Denial of recovery for non-standard tokens; funds remain stranded in the contract.",
