Impact: Unauthorized reinitialization leading to ownership takeover, configuration tampering, and fund redirection in derived implementations. Recommended mitigation: Make the external initialize function non-virtual and keep the initializer modifier there, then delegate to an internal virtual _initialize(bytes) function for implementers to override.
